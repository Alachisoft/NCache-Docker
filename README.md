NCache Enterprise comes with all features during evaluation period. But, it has a <span style="color:red">built-in performance limitation</span> (max 200 req/sec per cache per server) and the <span style="color:red">amount of activity limitation</span> (total 500,000 requests before a cache restart is required). You can remove these limitations from NCache Enterprise by requesting a <a href="http://www.alachisoft.com/request-trial.php/" target="_blank"> FREE 60-day Trial License Key</a> and activating all the cache servers with it. This Trial License Key can be extended upon additional request. And, when you purchase NCache Enterprise, the purchased license key also removes all these limitations.
