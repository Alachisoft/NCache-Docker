## Issues

## Licenses

*   NCache Enterprise is available free for 60 days with all features and no performance or other limitations. When the NCache image is launched for the first time, you are required to register NCache with free evaluation key using PowerShell command 'Register-NCacheEvaluation'. You can contact sales@alachisoft to get a free evaluation key. Upon purchase you will receive an annual subscription license key. Entering the annual subscription license key converts the product from evaluation mode to a purchased copy without any re-installation. And, the product works for one or more years (based on how many years subscription you have purchased). And, at the end of this subscription period you must renew the subscription or NCache stops working. However, youâ€™re given ample alerts at renewal time.

*   NCache docker images for Linux are based on [Ubuntu 22.04](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu) base image. The Ubuntu licensing is same as mentioned on [Ubuntu base image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu).
